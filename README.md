# ✈️ AirlineDB SQL Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview

The AirlineDB SQL Analytics Project focuses on solving real-world airline business problems using Structured Query Language (SQL). 

The AirlineDB dataset simulates an airline reservation and flight management system containing information related to bookings, tickets, flights, airports, aircrafts, and boarding passes.

The project demonstrates practical SQL skills by analyzing transactional airline data to extract insights, perform reporting analysis, and solve business-driven analytical questions.

Using relational database concepts and the AirlineDB schema, complex SQL queries were written to explore relationships between multiple tables and generate meaningful business outputs.
